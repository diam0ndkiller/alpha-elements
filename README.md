# alpha-elements
the alpha-elements minecraft launcher manager, built using python

To run, you need to download the [dcgf library](https://github.com/diam0ndkiller/dcgf) and extract the files either to your python package path or into `<.minecraft directory>/alpha_elements`.

AlphaElements is a launcher for the default [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) Launcher. 
It automatically installs the modded [Minecraft Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net) client and the 
performance and tweak mod [OptiFine](https://optifine.net). In AlphaElements you can import 
other mods and enable or disable them to your needs in different 
versions. When you're done, just launch the Minecraft Launcher 
using the Play button.
